Geometry/Construction/Lowering.lean — Construction → Scene Pos2.

First-cut lowering. Handles the patterns we need for "two points
determine a line" and the immediate next examples; the heavy
constraint-solving (positions discovered to satisfy quantitative
relations like `between A X B`) is stubbed and will land as a separate
pass when an example forces it.

Strategy:
- `exists … : Point` → allocate a position from a deterministic
  layout pool. Lines / circles / segments declared via `exists` get
  no position; they're expected to come in through `construct`.
- `construct name := expr` → dispatch on the expression head. Known
  shape constructors (`line_through`, `segment`, `circle`) emit the
  corresponding `Shape Pos2` referencing previously-allocated
  positions. Unknown constructors are recorded as Scene constraints
  (so they survive the lowering as metadata even when we can't
  realize them visually).
- `assert claim desc` → recorded verbatim into `Scene.constraints`.
  Asserts that constrain positions (e.g. `between`) currently shape
  no positions — solver land.

Labels for each named Point are emitted automatically. Names not
introduced via `exists Point` get no auto-label; if you want a label
for a constructed object you can add it explicitly later (e.g. via
an annotation pass).

/-! ## Layout pool

Deterministic position allocation for free `exists Point` declarations
on a 640×480 canvas. Pool index 0 sits at the bottom-left (~210°),
index 1 at the bottom-right (~330°), index 2 at the top (~90°), with
further indices evenly distributed. Names are alphabetized before
indexing into the pool — so the alphabetically-first point reads as
the bottom-left vertex, matching standard geometry-text conventions.
A solver pass would adjust these to satisfy quantitative asserts. -/

/-- Canonical anchor angles for the alphabetized point list. First
two slots form a horizontal AB pair at the bottom (210°, 330°), third
goes to the apex (90°), then auxiliary slots fan out across the
upper arc. Going beyond six points loops to the bottom; if Joe ever
constructs a figure with that many free points, refine then. -/

/-! ## State

A small append-only state threaded through the statement walk. Maps
each declared name to its assigned `Pos2` (for points) plus an emitted
shape (for constructed objects). The sort tag lets us auto-label
points without needing to inspect the source statement later. -/

/-! ## Axis pair

Used by the solver to pin the figure's canonical orientation. We pick
the alphabetically-earliest pair of points that anchor a segment / line
/ ray construct — for Pasch (segments AB, BC, AC) this is (A, B); for
TwoPointsLine (line PQ) it is (P, Q). Both endpoints are pinned at
their warm-start positions so the resulting figure reads "A on the
left, B on the right, AB horizontal" without a post-pass rotation.

A `focus N` statement overrides the auto-pick: `N` may name a
segment / line_through / ray construct (in which case its endpoints
become the axis) or an existential Line (in which case the first two
`incident` anchors become the axis; if only one anchor exists, that
single point is pinned at the canvas center and the line is drawn
horizontally through it). -/

/-- Pre-lowering rewrite: every existential Line must end up with at
least two `incident` anchors so it has a determinate position and
direction.

Two strategies in play:
- **Unfocused lines**: user-supplied incidents fill anchor slots
  first; remaining slots get synthesized hidden anchor points named
  `~h_<L>_<k>` appended at the end of stmts. The line is drawn
  through whichever two anchors come first (in source order).
- **Focused lines**: always synthesize two dedicated axis anchors
  named `~axL_<L>_<k>`, with their `incident` asserts inserted at the
  START of stmts so `lineAnchors` returns them first and the line is
  drawn through THEM (horizontal). User-named incidents on the
  focused line stay as regular incidents — they aren't pinned, and
  they get an `incidentOnLine` projection onto the axis anchors so
  they sit on the rendered line while still moving to satisfy other
  constraints (e.g. `between A X B` for X).

The `~` prefix on anchor names is past `z` in ASCII so these don't
collide with any user identifier in the alphabetized layout pool. -/

/-! ## Top-level lowering

Four-phase walk:
1. `exists` declarations seed positions from the alphabetized layout
   pool (alphabetically-first name → bottom-left, etc.).
2. `assert` claims apply (some bias positions, e.g. `between`).
3. Shapes for declared names are emitted (`exists`-points and any
   line materialized via incidence).
4. `construct` statements emit further shapes referencing positions
   resolved by the prior phases.
Final pass translates everything so the point centroid sits at the
canvas center. -/

/-! ## Force-directed solver pass

Phase A wires the heuristic layout into the solver as a *warm start*:
points seeded by `applyExists` are loaded into a `World`, springs are
added for each edge-shaped construct (segment / line_through / ray),
random rest-length jitter breaks accidental symmetries (e.g. exact
equilateral triangles), and the solver runs to equilibrium. The
resulting positions overwrite `Bindings.positions`. Asserts and
shape emission downstream see the perturbed positions. -/

/-- Collect projections from `assert` stmts.

- A `between A X B` whose middle particle X appears in only one
  `between` assert becomes `Projections.between`, snapping X onto
  segment AB interior.
- When two `between` asserts share the same middle X (e.g. `between
  A X B` and `between C X D`), they collapse into one
  `Projections.intersect2` that snaps X to the intersection of lines
  AB and CD.
- A `between A X B` whose middle X is also an `incident X L` on the
  focused line collapses into an `intersect2(A, B, ax0, ax1, X)`
  where `(ax0, ax1)` are the focused line's axis anchors. This
  snaps X exactly to segment AB ∩ L in one step instead of
  oscillating between two single-axis projections.
- `collinear A B C ...` snaps the rest onto the line through the
  first two.
- Multi-incidence on the same Line (`incident P L`, `incident Q L`,
  `incident R L`, ...) collapses to one collinear projection over
  the incident points.
- Pure metadata asserts (`distinct`, `¬`, ...) produce no
  projection. -/

/-- DSL → SVG via the lowering pass. Lets atlas's `direct_rep` accept
a `Construction` literal directly (instance lookup picks this up by
type), without callers needing to invoke `lower` themselves. The
default `Renderable` instance keeps the inline `<style>` block so
the SVG is standalone (works in the InfoView widget, libresvg,
direct file-open). -/

own stylesheet + page background (e.g. the atlas viewer's editorial

The output still carries the `.txt`, `.lbl`, `.callout` classes so
the host CSS can target them. -/

figure deltas next to each `auxillary { … }` step in the proof. -/
