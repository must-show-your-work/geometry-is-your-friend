# Constructors

Derived geometric objects built on `Point` + `Between`: segments, rays,
extensions, line-through-two-points, and intersections. Each line-part is
a typed `structure` parameterized by its defining points, with a
`@[reducible]` `carrier : Set Point` projection holding the underlying
disjunction-set Greenberg's original defs used.

`Membership Point X` and `CoeHead X (Set Point)` instances let these
behave transparently as sets — `P ∈ segment A B` and `segment A B ⊆ line A B`
work without manual coercion.

The surface syntax (`segment A B`, `ray A B`, etc., plus the `the X`
prefixed forms) is unchanged from the original Set-Point-based defs;
only the underlying types differ. The `on` macro_rules expand
`P on segment A B` to `P ∈ (segment A B)`.

/-! ## Typed line-part structures

    Each structure carries a `Unit` token to keep it in `Type` (Lean's
    structure-is-Prop rule would otherwise fire on an empty record).
    Endpoints are *type-level* parameters, not fields — recoverable by
    unification at use sites.

  type_token : Unit := ()

/-! ## Carriers — projection to `Set Point`

    Reducible defs that unfold to the same set-theoretic content as
    Greenberg's original `Segment`/`Ray`/`Extension`/`LineThrough`. The
    bodies are *literally* the old definitions — no semantic shift.

  {C | A - B - C ∧ A ≠ C ∧ B ≠ C}

@[reducible] def Ray.carrier {A B : Point} (_r : Ray A B) : Set Point :=
  {C | (A - C - B) ∨ A = C ∨ B = C} ∪ {C | A - B - C ∧ A ≠ C ∧ B ≠ C}

@[reducible] def LineThrough.carrier {A B : Point} (_L : LineThrough A B) : Set Point :=
  {C | C = A ∨ C = B ∨ A - C - B ∨ A - B - C ∨ C - A - B}

/-! ## Pretty-printer unexpanders — proof states show the surface syntax

    Without these, goals render the elaborated form (e.g.
    `{ toSet := (Segment.between A B).carrier }`) which is unreadable.
    Each unexpander brings constructor applications back to surface form.

/-! ## `CoeHead` to the abstract `Line`

    With `Line` now an opaque-ish wrapper around `Set Point`, line-parts
    coerce to `Line` by wrapping their carrier. This makes
    `ray A B ⊆ line A B`, `segment A B = L`, etc. work without the
    `(... : Set Point)` ascription — both sides land in `Line` via Coe.

/-! ## Cross-line-part comparison auto-coercion — bottom of the warren

    `Eq` / `Ne` / `⊆` / `∩` / `∪` between two typed line-parts of different
    shapes (e.g. `segment A B = segment B C`) fail to elaborate by default
    because Lean picks the LHS type and refuses to coerce the RHS to a
    common ambient.

    **What we tried, and why each failed:**

    1. `macro_rules` matching `$lhs = $rhs`: never fires. `=` / `≠` / `⊆`
       go through Lean's `binrel%` machinery which intercepts the syntax
       below the macro layer. Term-level `macro_rules` never sees these.

    2. Replacing `CoeHead X Line` with `Coe X Line` (so Lean's `binrel%`
       might use it to find a common type): hits "instance does not
       provide concrete values for (semi-)out-params" at the instance
       declaration. The line-parts being parameterized by `A B : Point`
       means a `Coe (Segment A B) Line` instance has free A and B that
       Lean's typeclass resolver can't pin down at search time.

    3. `term_elab` / `binop_elab` hook on `Eq` directly: would require
       writing a Lean elaborator extension that inspects elaborated
       argument types, recognizes the line-part-vs-line-part pattern,
       and inserts `CoeHead.coe` to `Line` on both sides. ~80 LOC of
       elaborator code, touches Lean's elaboration loop, and requires
       intimate knowledge of how `binrel%` / `Lean.Elab.BinOp` interact
       with `Lean.Meta.coercedTo?` — interface that's not stable across
       Lean versions.

    **Convention going forward:** at the ~25 cross-line-part comparison
    sites in the codebase, anchor the LHS with `(... : Line)`. The RHS
    auto-coerces via `CoeHead`. Example:
    ```
    (segment A B : Line) = segment B A   -- ✓ — LHS anchors, RHS auto-coerces
    (segment A B : Line) ⊆ line A B      -- ✓ — same pattern
    segment A B = segment B C            -- ✗ — Lean picks Segment A B as type, can't coerce
    ```

    If the elaborator extension ever becomes worth ~80 LOC + the
    Lean-internal API risk, the right hook point is `binrel%` / each
    operator's elabFn. We've exhausted the cheaper options.
-/

/-! ## Cross-type subset is via explicit `(↑x : Set Point)` ascription.

    `HasSubset` is a unary typeclass — same type both sides — so writing
    `ray A B ⊆ line A B` (different typed structures) doesn't elaborate.
    The `CoeHead X (Set Point)` instances above let call sites coerce
    explicitly: `(↑(ray A B) : Set Point) ⊆ line A B` (or the symmetric
    ascription on the RHS). Affects only the few subset-between-line-parts
    lemmas (1.0.8, 2.0.4); the typical `P on x` / `s ≠ L` use cases work
    without ascription.

/-! ## `mem_def` bridges — `Iff.rfl` to the underlying disjunction

    Tagged `@[simp, obvious]` so tactics see through to the same shape
    Greenberg's set-based defs exposed directly.

@[simp, obvious] theorem Segment.mem_def {A B : Point} {s : Segment A B} {P : Point} :
  P ∈ s ↔ (A - P - B) ∨ A = P ∨ B = P := Iff.rfl

@[simp, obvious] theorem Ray.mem_def {A B : Point} {r : Ray A B} {P : Point} :
  P ∈ r ↔ ((A - P - B) ∨ A = P ∨ B = P) ∨ (A - B - P ∧ A ≠ P ∧ B ≠ P) := Iff.rfl

@[simp, obvious] theorem Extension.mem_def {A B : Point} {e : Extension A B} {P : Point} :

  P ∈ L ↔ P = A ∨ P = B ∨ A - P - B ∨ A - B - P ∨ P - A - B := Iff.rfl

/-! ## Coercion-membership bridges

    `P ∈ (↑x : Line) ↔ P ∈ x` for each line-part. Both sides reduce to
    `P ∈ x.carrier`, but they go through different `Membership` instances
    (Line's via `.toSet`, line-part's via `.carrier`), so simp doesn't
    unify them without an explicit bridge.

    Tagged `@[simp, obvious]` so `Line.mem_inter` etc. can rewrite a goal
    like `X ∈ L ∩ ray A B` into `X ∈ L ∧ X ∈ ray A B` and have the second
    conjunct match a `X ∈ ray A B` hypothesis. -/
